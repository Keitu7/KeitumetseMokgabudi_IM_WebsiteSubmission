                    Below are images of the Original WireFrames. 
                    This design included each section/page all onto a continuous single page - 
                    thereofore the user would scroll downwards through the site. This design would call for each section/page to be included in the nav bar menue. 
                    In that way, to simplify the UI and UX navigation throughout the site, the user would select the menue button to whichever section they wanted to skip to or go back to.

                    GOAL ALIGNMENT - the goal for this website, as to essure that I well fit the theme of 'Space' with the elements of blogs, wireframes and styel guide sections neccessary for this site. 
                    \I did originally think of taking a different route this time, and try an interface desgin that went straight through and continued all on one page. Therefore users would only need to 
                    scroll up and down throughout the entire website. This may still be an idea I would to explore and challenge myself with. But overall, essentially the goal is create a simple, easy to 
                    understand interface that still uses and upholds conventional web design UI interface. To stick to the theme, and make all elements work well together. For instance, establishing a colour palette, 
                    font/s and UI designs that blend well together - the goal is to keep my site user-friendly and easy to use, while still successfully getting the theme, purpose and meaning across.

                <p id="para3">
                    INFORMATION STRUCTURE - below is an image of how I see the user navigatign through the site and how I structured it so that from the Homepage, 
                    the user is 'directed' or navigated to explore the Aboutpage (as an obvious sign). This content map explores what each page entials, communicating the brainstorming stages during the desgin stage.

                <p id="para4">
                    SELECTED INTERFACE ELEMENTS - concerning the selected interface elements, I opted for an easy simple UI interfce flow. 
                    This can be noted firstly on the HomePage. The user is greeted with a thematic background, which could already give context to what the sites theme is.
                     Then they are presented with 'focused' navigational options on how to move forwards on the site, e.g., Either explore via the Nav bar, or select the 'Let's go!' tab. 
                    I used this interface element not to limit the user, but provide them with a straight-to-the-point, simple interface around this space.

                    AESTHETIC and GOAL - for the visually appealing style, I went for an asthetic of course related to the selected theme 'Space' 
                    and as inspired by the different space themed websites and various artworks available, I selected a dark blue-to-black 
                    colour scheme. The HomePage background already so perfectly communicates the aesthetic, style, font type, size, and 
                    colour scheme, all so well. I was aiming for a 'NASA's site' inspired asethetic, mixed with my own touch. 
                </p>

                <p id="piece2">
                    VISUAL ELEMENTS SELECTED - the visual elements used were particularly straight lines, and square and rectangle shapes for a more seemingly clean, somewhat formal and a tad old fashioned at the same time style. 
                    Colour would be the use of only darker shades from the blue colour scheme palette. Space - sufficient use white space left out to create a more free, floaty, roomy, spacious feel for the representation of SPACE. 
                </p>

                <P id="piece3">
                    FONT STYLE - the font styles used for an aesthetically pleasing interface, in connection with the theme, is the family-font: system-ui, -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Open Sans', 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif, AND 'Franklin Gothic Medium', 'Arial Narrow', Arial, sans-serif font. 
                    The font sizes varying from 21px to 3rem to 66px.

                    The Homepage wireframe, now includes an image card with contextual information concerning the selected theme. With this, will be a provied background piece which will provide further context and text on the chosen theme.
                    The information card will provide a contextual introduction of the purpose/theme of the site to the user. 
                    Using certain UI elements, the Info card will introduce the user to a somewhat interactive interface - contributing to the site's UX.

                    Revised AESTHETIC and GOAL - Aesthetic wise, the colour scheme still finds balance in the calm, dark blue pigmnets, with shifting darks shades to a blue tint corner background. The selected dark blue-to-black 
                    colour scheme helps attract the eye to lighter/brighter elemnts of importance on the page/s. The HomePage background stills aims to communicates the aesthetic, style, font type, size, and 
                    colour scheme of the site relating it to the theme.

                <p id="piece2">
                    LAYOUT - White Space - I envisioned spacious, more white space 'filled' layout specifically on the Homepage, to create a free, spacious 'space' feel going on with the theme. 
                    This can noted through the interface element layout of the buttons, informations cards and minimised text.
