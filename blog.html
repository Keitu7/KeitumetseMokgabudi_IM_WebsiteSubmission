                    Although there be thorough definitions/ explanations of what data visualization entails, 
                    I have come to understand that Data Visualization is essentially concerned with taking raw data 
                    and trying to make sense of it in a more readable, visually appealing way to the average human. 
                    During this period, I have learned that data does not have to be presented as is, in its complex 
                    quantitative state but rather in a data visual representation form/pattern through graphics that 
                    makes the exploring and analysing of data more appealing and easier to consume (Li, 2020;18).  
                    The term Data Visualization is a concept dating back to the 2nd century AD (Li, 2020;17), 
                    where drawings/visual representations were used to provide illustrations/ visual demonstrations 
                    of the mapping of the world and keep a record of historical events (Li, 2020;17).  
                    Although much drawing and illustration is still done, today, the invention of computer technology 
                    has allowed for a change in the way the record and visual representation of data is kept and stored.  
                    With the evolving and improvement in technology from hand drawing (Li, 2020;17) the use of computer 
                    technology such as graphics and software has allowed for a user exploration and manipulation of data, 
                    on Data Visualizing forms/ content as presented somewhere. Fundamentally, data visualization is concerned 
                    with representing vast amounts of data usually in graphical images of data which then enhance understanding 
                    and enable the average human viewer to identify properties and patterns in the data, “immediately formulating 
                    new insights” (Li, 2020;18) regarding the new visualized data form/format.
                </p>
                <p id="para2">
                    Data Visualization may be defined in a manner focusing on the relationship between data and computer technology; 
                    how technology can transform data into a visual display (Li, 2020; 18). In his reading ‘Overview of Data Visualization’ 2020, 
                    Li quotes several writers on their definitions of data visualization (well at least concerning their field specifically), 
                    we can gather that they define data visualization as the transformation of quantitative/raw data, where the ‘now’ transformed 
                    data is represented in a way that “exploits our visual perception abilities” (Kirk, 2012 in Li, 2020;18) and amplifies cognition – 
                    it results in increased volume of human cognition and apprehension (Li, 2020; 18). In understanding the visual representation of data, 
                    Li states that the purpose of data visualization is in identifying patterns inside the visualized graphic by exploring and analysing 
                    the ‘transformed’ data (Li, 2020;18). Bikakis (2018) in Li, thus says that data visualization is the presentation of raw, vast in amount, 
                    quantitative data in a pictorial, visual, or graphical format, and the data visualizing tool used is known as the software that generates 
                    that specific format presentation. Li goes on to speak of four aspects involved in data visualization which refer to real-time interaction, 
                    visual scalability, on-the-fly processing, and user assistance and personalization (Li, 2020; 18). These aspects/techniques address the 
                    essential feature of modern visualization – that there be “user comprehension and customization capabilities to various” 
                    (Bikakis, 2018 in Li, 2020; 18) and possible user exploration and manipulation scenarios and preferences (Bikakis, 2018 in Li, 2020;19). 
                    Li also categorizes data visualization into two sub-fields: information visualization and scientific visualization. 
                    Although both focus on transforming data into a visual form for it to become understandable information, 
                    information visualization represents abstract data and scientific represents physically based data 
                    (Spence, 2007 in Li, 2020;19). Taking into consideration the abovementioned points, I have come to
                     understand data visualization concerning the web to refer to the practice of presenting data in a 
                     visual, graphic, and interactive format on websites/web-based platforms. The represented data transformed 
                     into effectively readable information is presented using graphical elements and pictorials such as charts, 
                     graphs, timelines, tables, and maps, etc., and essentially aim to create and present raw data as information 
                     in a more accessible, understandable, and actionable display for a broader audience. Before delving into the 
                     key aspects drawn from this reading and further research, I want to step back and understand the relation 
                     between defining data and information as mentioned by Li. 
                </p>
                <p id="para3">
                    From Li’s reading, I understand data as the raw, unprocessed information that has not yet been recognized to have meaning, 
                    which can then be organized into categories such as names, quantifiable units, numbers, age, symbols, etc. and exists simply because it does, 
                    in any form (Bellinger et al. 2004 in Li, 2020; 20). Data then comes in two types, primary and secondary data (Agarwal, 2006 in Li, 2020;20). 
                    The primary data is data that is collected solely for the study of information, it is the raw data, while the secondary data is the 
                    “information contained in data” (Li, 2020;20) which is then used again, processed from records, and analysed to extract/draw 
                    information for another purpose, it is considered as Information. Essentially, data and information are closely linked in that 
                    data is the unprocessed information which then becomes processed data, known as Information (Li, 2020;21). Now that there is an 
                    understanding that data in itself “has no value, significance or meaning until” (Bellinger et al., 2004 in Li, 2020;21) it is 
                    processed into information understandable by the average human, we can understand the need to visualize data and process it into 
                    readable forms of presentation – these would then involve the forms of traditional and modern Data Visualization. 
                </p>
                <p id="para4">
                    In conclusion, I learned that data visualization is not only concerned with showing information in simple, understandable, and accessible forms; 
                    but that the connections between the data and information and the importance of processing data into information are a crucial part of 
                    visualizing data as data visualization is more than just making a chart look nice. What I must note when approaching my assignments 
                    with the task of developing/designing data visualization forms/charts, is to consider what type of data I am going to process into 
                    comprehensive Information; consider the suited graphic form between tables, charts, trees, maps, diagrams graphs, etc., and the 
                    provided theme and its raw data. And lastly, considering some key aspects such as the practical Data storytelling interactive 
                    elements of visuals/graphics, the Real-time data, and the Responsiveness of data visualizations so as adapting to different 
                    screen sizes/devices, Scalability, Graphs, and Chart types, and Accessibility – The essential takeaway is that better than 
                    making sense of raw data into information, we can also “make it sing” (O’Brien, 2022).

                <p id="sec1">
                    Considering the importance of the UI and UX components of web development which create the website’s visually appealing, 
                    user-friendly, and seamless user experience, designing an effective UI and UX was the prime goal in creating an aesthetically 
                    pleasing and intuitive interface for this site/space. With a focus on the UI design, I sought an interface that would allow users 
                    to interact with the website's features, visual elements, and functions by considering elements such as the Layout of each element 
                    arrangement on the screen – the navigation bar, extra contextual information of the site’s overall purpose and theme. And I did 
                    communicate that using the colour scheme and background video/image which indicated the thematic space tone. The typography consisted 
                    of selecting the appropriate text font and formatting, readability, and visual appeal. I maintained consistency in font style 
                    (with two-three different font styles) to accommodate the readability of the blog paragraphs, the logo, and the nav bar text which 
                    had to stand out in font weight and size. Icons and images: the images I have used are not necessarily interactable, however, the logo 
                    icon does communicate the name and beginning/start of the website through its interactable display leading the user back to the Homepage 
                    (the beginning). Buttons and controls: in creating clear user actions, the clickable buttons are visually distinct through the\
                     ‘highlight on hover’ interaction. Consistency: the website maintains a uniform look and feel across the different pages/sections. 
                     This can be seen through the maintained thematic background colour scheme, consistent navigation bar (top and bottom), and font size/s. 
                </p>
                <p id="sec2">
                    The User Experience focuses on the users’ overall interactive experience with the website. 
                    This goes to consider the user’s feelings while negating through the website, their emotions, 
                    needs, goals, and satisfaction in exploring the site with ease. The UX design by aiming to make the 
                    user’s experience/journey, must ensure a smoothly interactable, enjoyable, meaningful, and functional website. 
                    This section would therefore involve conducting research, planning and constant iteration, and user expectation 
                    to understand what the user needs.  In my process of collecting UX research, I used user flow mappings which include 
                    mappings of the content display and user paths. User paths describe and mapping the possible paths users would take in 
                    negating through the website. Wireframing and style guide: this helped in creating visualised user experience mappings of 
                    the website structure. Accessibility and performance: aiming at optimising loading times, responsiveness, and usability by 
                    people with disabilities, these are aspects that still lack and require work on my site for it to offer its potential, optimised UX. 
                </p>
                <p id="sec3">
                    Designing a user-friendly and visually appealing User Interface is essentially the crucial part of creating an optimised and positively
                     engaging User Experience – as users are essentially interacting with the visual aspects/ interface of the site for them to 
                     receive/feel/experience the engagement of the site’s elements. UI helps communicate and produce an experience of the site’s interface,
                      navigation, and functionality. Therefore, the overall elements that I will keep in mind as the iteration process of this website continues
                       is to consider the User-Centred Design by prioritizing user needs, conventional UI interface designs, and simple, clear, and understandable 
                       UI designs. Consistency: maintaining the established design that I have implemented across the site. This being the blue colour scheme theme, 
                       white and tinted blue text that communicates the ‘Space’ theme. The Navigation: I have a simple and clear navigation system as can be noted 
                       from the Homepage. The ‘Let’s go!” button directs users to exactly where they need to be after the homepage (the About page which leads to 
                       more options), avoiding leading them to ‘extra’ informative spaces on the site.  The About page then offers more simply designed and 
                       interfaced navigation - the other four pages, while still maintaining the navigation at the top (in the nav bar). The uses Visually appealing, 
                       high-quality images that work along and communicate the selected theme, whilst all without overloading the interface with too many elements that 
                       could distract the user. The iterative process is to include the development of user feedback, accessibility, graphics load speed and pause, 
                       and responsive design – all to be explored in improving the overall user experience.
