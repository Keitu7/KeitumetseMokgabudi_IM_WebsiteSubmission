                        Although there be thorough definitions/ explanations of what data visualization entails, 
                        I have come to understand that Data Visualization is essentially concerned with taking raw data 
                        and trying to make sense of it in a more readable, visually appealing way to the average human. 
                        During this period, I have learned that data does not have to be presented as is, in its complex 
                        quantitative state but rather in a data visual representation form/pattern through graphics that 
                        makes the exploring and analysing of data more appealing and easier to consume (Li, 2020;18).  
                        The term Data Visualization is a concept dating back to the 2nd century AD (Li, 2020;17), 
                        where drawings/visual representations were used to provide illustrations/ visual demonstrations 
                        of the mapping of the world and keep a record of historical events (Li, 2020;17).  
                        Although much drawing and illustration is still done, today, the invention of computer technology 
                        has allowed for a change in the way the record and visual representation of data is kept and stored.  
                        With the evolving and improvement in technology from hand drawing (Li, 2020;17) the use of computer 
                        technology such as graphics and software has allowed for a user exploration and manipulation of data, 
                        on Data Visualizing forms/ content as presented somewhere. Fundamentally, data visualization is concerned 
                        with representing vast amounts of data usually in graphical images of data which then enhance understanding 
                        and enable the average human viewer to identify properties and patterns in the data, “immediately formulating 
                        new insights” (Li, 2020;18) regarding the new visualized data form/format.
                    </p>
                    <p id="para2">
                        Data Visualization may be defined in a manner focusing on the relationship between data and computer technology; 
                        how technology can transform data into a visual display (Li, 2020; 18). In his reading ‘Overview of Data Visualization’ 2020, 
                        Li quotes several writers on their definitions of data visualization (well at least concerning their field specifically), 
                        we can gather that they define data visualization as the transformation of quantitative/raw data, where the ‘now’ transformed 
                        data is represented in a way that “exploits our visual perception abilities” (Kirk, 2012 in Li, 2020;18) and amplifies cognition – 
                        it results in increased volume of human cognition and apprehension (Li, 2020; 18). In understanding the visual representation of data, 
                        Li states that the purpose of data visualization is in identifying patterns inside the visualized graphic by exploring and analysing 
                        the ‘transformed’ data (Li, 2020;18). Bikakis (2018) in Li, thus says that data visualization is the presentation of raw, vast in amount, 
                        quantitative data in a pictorial, visual, or graphical format, and the data visualizing tool used is known as the software that generates 
                        that specific format presentation. Li goes on to speak of four aspects involved in data visualization which refer to real-time interaction, 
                        visual scalability, on-the-fly processing, and user assistance and personalization (Li, 2020; 18). These aspects/techniques address the 
                        essential feature of modern visualization – that there be “user comprehension and customization capabilities to various” 
                        (Bikakis, 2018 in Li, 2020; 18) and possible user exploration and manipulation scenarios and preferences (Bikakis, 2018 in Li, 2020;19). 
                        Li also categorizes data visualization into two sub-fields: information visualization and scientific visualization. 
                        Although both focus on transforming data into a visual form for it to become understandable information, 
                        information visualization represents abstract data and scientific represents physically based data 
                        (Spence, 2007 in Li, 2020;19). Taking into consideration the abovementioned points, I have come to
                         understand data visualization concerning the web to refer to the practice of presenting data in a 
                         visual, graphic, and interactive format on websites/web-based platforms. The represented data transformed 
                         into effectively readable information is presented using graphical elements and pictorials such as charts, 
                         graphs, timelines, tables, and maps, etc., and essentially aim to create and present raw data as information 
                         in a more accessible, understandable, and actionable display for a broader audience. Before delving into the 
                         key aspects drawn from this reading and further research, I want to step back and understand the relation 
                         between defining data and information as mentioned by Li. 
                    </p>
                    <p id="para3">
                        From Li’s reading, I understand data as the raw, unprocessed information that has not yet been recognized to have meaning, 
                        which can then be organized into categories such as names, quantifiable units, numbers, age, symbols, etc. and exists simply because it does, 
                        in any form (Bellinger et al. 2004 in Li, 2020; 20). Data then comes in two types, primary and secondary data (Agarwal, 2006 in Li, 2020;20). 
                        The primary data is data that is collected solely for the study of information, it is the raw data, while the secondary data is the 
                        “information contained in data” (Li, 2020;20) which is then used again, processed from records, and analysed to extract/draw 
                        information for another purpose, it is considered as Information. Essentially, data and information are closely linked in that 
                        data is the unprocessed information which then becomes processed data, known as Information (Li, 2020;21). Now that there is an 
                        understanding that data in itself “has no value, significance or meaning until” (Bellinger et al., 2004 in Li, 2020;21) it is 
                        processed into information understandable by the average human, we can understand the need to visualize data and process it into 
                        readable forms of presentation – these would then involve the forms of traditional and modern Data Visualization. 
                    </p>
                    <p id="para4">
                        In conclusion, I learned that data visualization is not only concerned with showing information in simple, understandable, and accessible forms; 
                        but that the connections between the data and information and the importance of processing data into information are a crucial part of 
                        visualizing data as data visualization is more than just making a chart look nice. What I must note when approaching my assignments 
                        with the task of developing/designing data visualization forms/charts, is to consider what type of data I am going to process into 
                        comprehensive Information; consider the suited graphic form between tables, charts, trees, maps, diagrams graphs, etc., and the 
                        provided theme and its raw data. And lastly, considering some key aspects such as the practical Data storytelling interactive 
                        elements of visuals/graphics, the Real-time data, and the Responsiveness of data visualizations so as adapting to different 
                        screen sizes/devices, Scalability, Graphs, and Chart types, and Accessibility – The essential takeaway is that better than 
                        making sense of raw data into information, we can also “make it sing” (O’Brien, 2022).

                        Although a broad concept, design is generally concerned with the process of envisioning, planning, and conceptualizing the creation of objects, projects, buildings, interactive systems, etc. (Strate School Of Design, 2018). 
                        It is not merely making something look pretty but with the product functionality, together with its aesthetic usefulness. Whether in Art or Science, design considers the crafting creation of the item. 
                        It is concerned with addressing a particular need and solving a problem – “To quote Steve Jobs: “Design is not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works.” …” (Strate School Of Design, 2018). 
                        Similarly, design in the context of web design would involve the creative process of visualising, planning, and arranging the elements (more specifically) that make up the website interface. 
                        This would then entail the principles/elements of UI and UX, encompassing the visual aesthetics, creative design and organisation, layout and style as part of the user interface, and the overall website user experience. 
                        My understanding that of design involves the conscious aim and effort to plan, visualize, and arrange meaningful order (Papanek, 1984), I have been better able to explain, iterate, and revise the meaning through which I had aimed to create my site using certain UI and UI elements/principles. 
                    </p>
                    <p id="para2">
                        I have considered the main aim/goal is for the site to offer simplicity overall. In that, I had aimed for simplicity in functionality and visual aesthetic and design. 
                        What was considered the key components for my site’s design in simplicity were the visual elements as an overall aesthetic, the layout, consistency, 
                        branding and identity/theme, structure and user interface, and experience.
                    </p>
                    <p id="sec3">
                        THE THEME and VISUAL ELEMENTS:
                    </p>
                    <p id="para4">
                        Reflecting on the choice of the colour scheme based on the selected theme. 
                        <em>Colour </em>– The selected colour scheme and palette were chosen in consideration of the theme of Outer Space. 
                        The colour palette uses the Dark Blue #09029e colour as the main colour used throughout the entire site background. 
                        The palette uses even darker and lighter shades of this blue to enhance and highlight certain sections/aspects/elements 
                        – the lighter gradation highlighting the more important aspects and content of the page e.g. The Logo, normally I would consider important as it represents the brand (the WHO of the site). 
                        The darker gradients would not hide but rather make that certain content the least bit important. This would be the extra/ mini nav bar at the bottom of the page. 
                        Although the gradation element might still need iteration. 
                    </p>
                    <p id="sec5">
                        <em>Font Choice & Typography –</em> The style choice and appearance aimed for was a clear, simple, and formal font for consistent use. 
                        The statistical data information, blogs, nav bar, and logo would all use the same font (of course only size differentiating here and there) – 
                        'Franklin Gothic Medium', 'Arial Narrow', Arial, sans-serif; Font colour - #d6fdfd. This colour stands out boldly and contrasts with the dark blue background gradient, which essentially makes readability clear, 
                        yet not too sharp against the dark background (hence the colour being pure white). The typography consisted of selecting the appropriate text font and formatting, readability, and visual appeal. 
                        I maintained consistency in font style (with two or three different font sizes and styles) to accommodate the readability of the blog paragraphs, the logo, and the nav bar text which had to stand out in font weight and size.

                    </p>
                    <p id="sec6">
                        <em>Language –</em> The language and tone of words used to navigate the user across the site will be, once again simple English text. 
                        The Nav bar will direct the user simply to the Homepage, About, and Contacts – this Nav bar still uses and maintains easily 
                        recognisable and already established Nav bar UI conventions. Word processing – striving for clarity, aiming for simplicity, and minimizing “actions and steps per screen” (UXPin, 2020). 
                        Keeping in mind the 3-click rule, not taking “more than three clicks to find any information” (UXPin, 2020), this site gets the user to the next (About) page with one click. 
                        The link to the next piece of information takes the user directly to what the About page entails and is about. Without having the user spend much time figuring out how to access 
                        the ‘Blog’, ‘Design’, or ‘Visualization’ page, buttoned links to these pages use a bold, larger print/ text font. 
                        Interface invisibility – interaction with these buttons is in the ‘highlight over hover’ function/ interface, providing the user with a clear direction of interactable UI component.
                    </p>
                    <p id="sec7">
                        <em>Making it Flexible, accessible, and Functional –</em> More of the interface interactivity will be with the data visualisation section and its 
                        relatedness to the rest of the UI and theme, therefore creating the overall User experience. 
                        In this section, I have identified this as a potential weakness that will still require focus and continuous reiterating.

                        <em>The logo –</em>the logo represents the brand/name of the site, which in this case is not necessarily important what it means but the Logo uses 
                        capitalized letters and is interactable with a ‘change colour over hover’ function. 
                        This already communicated to the user the significance this ‘part’ of the page has, 
                        contrasting the rest of the tags on the nav bar – its interactivity is communicated via the interface and response it gives the user.    
                    </p>
                    <p id="sec10">
                        <em>The brand/theme/tone/point of the site –</em> the purpose and first impression of the site is centrally communicated upon the users’ interaction with the Homepage. 
                        This consists of the layouts, colours, typography, and imagery. 
                        The Homepage (see figure 1.1) clearly communicates a simple one-click button that will the user to new information, with a background image/video that stands for the white space that could have been too plain should it have been a mere blue colour. 
                        However, I would like to add more interactivity later, where the background video/visual elements move in conjunction with the user’s mouse-pointed direction. Referencing one of Steve Jobs’ five design principles, 
                        for the Homepage I opted for the key and apparent principle of design – Simplicity. Achieving both usability and sophistication (Benfield, 2015). 
                    </p>
                    <p id="sec11">
                        <em>Theme, paragraph, styles, and stories –</em> Here, I aimed (and still working on) to begin and tell a story of sophistication and perfection, and visual representation through simplicity and minimalism 
                        – Job’s third principle. Again, referring to the ‘clutter is your enemy’ principle (Knaflic, 2015), with minimalism, we can help the user focus on the essential design element. 
                        I used Hicks law in the About page menu design, to achieve a minimised time for the user to make a decision (which may increase with time, given more options) (Goldberg, 2023).

                        Reflecting on the original wireframes versus the current ones (still subject to change slightly), the originals presented an interface that displayed one continuous page, separated into the homepage/section. 
                        Slide down into the About page/section, then down into the Blogs, etc. This design could work but for the sake of the clear-cut simple experience that I wanted to create for the user, I opted to separate the pages (perhaps even for myself). 
                        The ‘Visual structure’ would allow for more white space and less clutter, making the visuals appear less complicated and “cognitive load” extraneous (Knaflic, 2015). In creating the current wireframes, this design has allowed me to explore certain data visual graph redesigns. 
                        It caters to white space, allowing more room to move elements around across the pages. This white space will “leverage alignment of elements…help make the interpretation” (Knaflic, 2015) of my visuals and infographics a more comfortable and appealing user experience.

                        Considering the importance of the UI and UX components, designing a visually appealing, user-friendly, and seamless user interface, was the crucial point to get right (or least attempt to). goal in creating an aesthetically pleasing and intuitive interface for this site/space. 
                        With a focus on UI and UX design, I sought an interface that would allow users to interact with the website's features, visual elements, and functions with the least bit/minimum cognitive load.
                        This would call for designs that maintained consistent visual structure, and visual hierarchy that communicated the most important elements more clearly. For this, I considered the Laws that affect UX such as the Serial Position Effect, 
                        where the emphasis was made on key information at the beginning and end, etc. the Nav bar, and contact information. Importance and clarity are emphasized and emphasized through larger font-sized headings. Consistency: The site maintains a uniform look and feel across the different pages/sections. 
                        This can be seen through the maintained thematic background colour scheme, consistent navigation bar (top and bottom), and font size/s. 

                        With the UX design’s purpose to make the user’s interactive experience enjoyable, easy to use, and understand, meaningful, and functional research would be needed. By collecting information on user expectations and experience with my site, constant iteration will help improve the overall UI and UX experience more and more. 
                        Therefore, with more research, perhaps certain interface elements might be implemented e.g., Doing a hamburger/dropdown menu, making the About page a clear & blurred background pop up from the Homepage. Although the site may offer effective UI elements assisting with the overall user experience visually, 
                        Accessibility, and performance are sections/elements that I must imperatively focus on. 
                        Aiming to optimise loading times, responsiveness, and usability for people with disabilities, the accessibility and responsive design elements are aspects that still lack and require work, for the site it to offer its potential, optimised UX.

                        As I have gradually come to understand what data visualisation entails, what it means for web design/development, 
                        and what it does for the viewer, I have noted how closely data visualisation also links to user interface and user experience design
                        – this is where interaction begins emerges and displays importance. Data Visualisation does not only concern the use of visual elements
                        to portray the transformation and importance of raw data to assist users in comprehending and absorbing data faster, 
                        but it also concerns the overall experience. Thus, it is through interaction, that visually represented data
                        (graphs, charts, tables, etc.) can further enhance cognitive comprehension. Interaction with these visualisations 
                        not only helps viewers receive /absorb a visual understanding of the data, but it also involves aspects of what makes up 
                        the interactive dialogue with the data – the temporality in which the interaction takes place, the technological properties,
                        the visual properties, and the more abstract mediating entity of the interaction (Dimara & Perin, 2020; 122).
                        The following piece will reflect on the reading ‘What is Interaction for Data Visualisation’ by Dimara & Perin, 2020 and 
                        discuss an understanding of what Interaction means for Data Visualisation.

                    <p id="paragr2">
                        The reading essentially aims to understand what interaction is, and what it means for data visualisation. 
                        In doing that, the reading seeks to construct a solid definition of interaction, how to apply/integrate it, 
                        and explain what visualisation should seek to accomplish through interaction. In the process of establishing a 
                        solid working definition of interaction, the reading begins with the review results of a methodology rationale 
                        where the authors established a method for collecting papers, sending questionnaires to experts, creating a tagging method, 
                        and overall, a statistic summary of the review process. This methodological rationale helped filter 
                        the papers and questionnaire results from seed papers that offered unique definitions of interaction, linked papers that 
                        provided relevance to the search, to tags that provided the definition, benefit, critical, and concept of the term (interaction). 
                        The reading then discusses the Visualisation view of Interaction, in that, various definitions of the interaction of visualisation 
                        the benefits, and critiques of interaction are provided, emphasising the extent to which the concept’s definition/meaning runs in ambiguity.

                    <p id="paragr3">
                        In exploring the plausible definitions of interaction for visualisation, the authors offer insight into that the interaction of visualisation 
                        must involve components of external and internal entities and actions (Dimara & Perin, 2020; 121). As external mandatory entities, interaction 
                        must involve a user and the data. The user/viewer is a human with the “skills, abilities, expertise, and motivation” (Dimara & Perin, 2020; 122) 
                        to initiate the interaction. The data is the “intangible information source” (Dimara & Perin, 2020; 122) that provides the context of the visualisation. 
                        The user interacts with the data through “a mediating entity” (Dimara & Perin, 2020; 122), a visualisation system either being a whole or, as components 
                        referred to as technology, a computer (with hardware and software), and computational tools. When emphasizing its interface and visual properties, 
                        the visualisation system consists of representation, visualisation, display, maps, graphical marks, images, and visual metaphors (Dimara & Perin, 2020; 122). 
                        When referring to an abstract mediating entity, the system, workspace, interaction space, and analysis tool are considered/involved. 
                        Time is also an entity of interaction – as interaction is seen as an action carried out in real-time, with a start and end, which should provide an 
                        immediate result/response from the visualising system, with a start and end. 
                    </p>
                    <p id="paragr4">
                        Then there are the internal entities to consider: interaction being characterized as “a goal-oriented activity” (Dimara & Perin, 2020; 122) involving intent/goal/task or problem data-oriented. 
                        The intent, Dimara, and Perin mention describes the high-level data exploration, the generation of insights and information on the data, and the acquisition of multiple perspectives of data 
                        (Dimara & Perlin, 2020; 122). Moreover, the intent can also seek to collect and correct data, or intent to coordinate collaborative setups/ present data – these would be the internal/personal 
                        intents/goals or tasks for when interacting with data visualisations. Interaction also entails the external and external actions. 
                        The external actions describe interaction as the dialogue between the user and the visualisation system (Dimara & Perlin, 2020; 122) 
                        – which essentially creates an action-reaction relationship between the user and the visualisation system. The internal actions describe the relationship of interaction with the visualisation 
                        system involving a cognitive act of the user, a reasoning act from the user (Dimara & Perlin, 2020; 122). 
                    </p>
                    <p id="paragr5">
                        Although the authors mention to a further extent the properties/components that interaction for visualisation must/can involve, what I took away from the reading (together with the above-mentioned) 
                        is that interaction for visualisation can involve much more than merely the external entities of physical objects e.g., mouse, keyboard, etc. and physical constraints such as body movements, speech, 
                        arms and hands, head and eye movements (Dimara & Perlin, 2020; 122). The environment and space under which the interaction occurs as well as the number of users involved are also considered in defining interaction. 
                        What occurs in the user’s mind while processing the data information, memory encoding, and simulative reasoning (Dimara & Perlin, 2020; 122), much well reasons as dialogue and interaction with the data source. 
                        Dimara & Perlin suggest that there is more than what meets the eye in this picture. The interactive relation is not with the subject merely understanding the data that the visualisations are portraying, 
                        but rather it begins from the request-return dialogue happening in the viewing process (the process of understanding the data visualisation/s/graphs/charts). 
                    </p>
                    <p id="paragr6">
                        The Reported Benefits and Critiques of Interaction? Dimara & Perlin move on to speak of the benefits 39 papers reveal of interaction: interaction is seen as a mean to “amplify cognition in active, 
                        human-driven data exploration” (Dimara & Perlin, 2020; 123) in which the user/viewer can control the information space (Dimara & Perlin, 2020; 123). Through interactive manipulation, information and 
                        knowledge are “constructed, tested, refined and shared” (W. A. Pike, J. Stasko, R. Change & T. A. O’Connell in Dimara & Perlin, 2020; 123). Interaction leverages and puts to use human’s abilities 
                        through the construct of improved visualisation shapes, mediums and modalities, and input technologies, thus helping to make visualisations more accessible, reaching a wider audience 
                        (N. Elmqvist, A. V. Moere, H.-C. Jetter, D. Cernea, H. Reiterer, & T. Jankun-Kelly in Dimara & Perlin, 2020; 123). 
                    </p>
                    <p id="paragr7">
                        Dimara & Perlin base their understanding on two assumptions concerning visualisations as a subset of the interconnections/interactions with interactive systems in defining interaction for visualization. 
                        Thus, their definition is simply a compact definition for understanding interaction for visualisation: the interplay/ interactivity between a user and a data surface involving data-focused intent, 
                        with at least an action from the user and an interface response/reaction (Dimara & Perlin, 2020; 126). In constructing my understanding, what I have learned and should put into practice concerning 
                        designing Data visualisations, is that data visualisation is more than taking raw data and displaying it in a form that is more consumable to the average user (lacking background knowledge on scientific analysis and data). 
                        Rather, it is the experience the visualisations can provide for the user, and to experience, interaction is involved. Although Dimara and Perlin differentiate between interaction and interactivity, 
                        I will use the terms interchangeably for this brief description. Interaction involves and includes external entities and objects when seeking to engage the visualisations. 
                        There is interactivity with the technologies, mediums, and interfaces displaying the visualisations, there is interactivity with the modalities, interactivity in time, space, 
                        and dialogue of actions(input) and response (output) between the visualisation, interface, and user (Dimara & Perlin, 2020; 123). Interaction involving all these modalities is the key to creating the overall experience.
